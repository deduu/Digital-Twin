# Digital Twin
This repository contains ongoing work and information related to the Digital Twin (DT) development, the framework to sustain the change in DT, and the visualisation techniques to interface DT with different stakeholders.

Digital Twin (DT) was first introduced in aerospace field by NASA as "an integrated multi-physics, multiscale simulaion of a vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, ect., to mirror the life of its correspondin flying twin".

The attributes of DT that allow real-time field data management, bi-directional communication between physical and virtual representation, and integration with data analytics and the advanced visualisation techniques make DT becomes one of the most promising enabling technologies for realising 'Industrie 4.0'. 

Funded by EPSRC research grant, DigiTOP (Digital toolkit for optimisation of operators and technology in manufacturing partnerships) project develops a guideline for DT implementation to enable industries in different sectors harnessing the power of digitalisation to their own business benefits. 

This repository is structured as follows:
1. The figure below is an overview of the DT building steps

2. The example of how this guideline is applied to create a DT is provided for a [Gearbox demonstrator](Documents/Digital%20twin%20practice-v1.pdf)
3. Using the developed guideline, please refer to the [DT helicopter computer system](https://youtu.be/uNeu-z_tKP4) and the [DT of gearbox demonstrator](https://youtu.be/TLs_HygzAL8) to see how the Desktop-based DT and AR-based DT look like
4. For further development in the adaptive DT data framework (e.g. to sustain the change of DT when its physical counterpart evolves), please refer to this [article](Publications/A%20design%20framework%20for%20adaptive%20digital%20twin.pdf)
